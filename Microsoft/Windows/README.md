## Microsoft Windows

## Before you start
This archive contains important security policy settings which are recommended for a Windows deployment. Other settings (e.g. server address) should be chosen according to the relevant network configuration.

Remember, any guidance points given here are recommendations - they are not mandatory. Risk owners and administrators should review and agree a configuration which balances business requirements, usability and the security of the platform. 

This configuration was last tested against Windows 10 22H2 in December 2024 and Windows 11 in April 2025.

We recomend you check out the parent page [README](https://github.com/ukncsc/Device-Security-Guidance-Configuration-Packs) before using these guides. The guides listed here are designed for use with Microsoft Intune and can be loaded using the `.json` files in the pack and following the installation instructions linked under the __Supplementary Information__ section of this document.

The settings we have listed can be viewed reviewed manually inside the [Configurations 2025 (markdown)]() and [Configurations 2025 (csv)]() files.
